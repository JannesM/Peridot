# Peridot
A decentralized token created for Minecraft.

# What has been planed so far?
1. decentralized blockchain based on PoS (Proof of Stake) consensus
2. PoS validator election based on the value of items and the time played on a server
3. blockchain should be able to handle the custom Peridot-Token (PDT) as well as Minecraft items
4. those should be tradable via some exchange later on
