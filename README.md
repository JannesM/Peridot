A project demonstrating a blockchain.
#EducationalPurposes

Goal: In-Game crypto token for Minecraft

# What has been planed so far?
1. decentralized blockchain based on PoS (Proof of Stake) consensus
2. PoS-Validator election based on the value of items and the time played on a server
3. blockchain should be able to handle the custom Peridot-Token (PDT) as well as Minecraft items
4. those should be tradable via some exchange later on
